### The algorithm used to solve the N queens problem is a classic backtracking algorithm. Here is a brief overview of how it works:

Overview of the N Queens Problem
The N queens problem is about placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means:

No two queens can be in the same row.
No two queens can be in the same column.
No two queens can be on the same diagonal.
Backtracking Algorithm
The backtracking approach systematically searches for a solution by trying to build a solution incrementally and abandoning ("backtracking") as soon as it determines that the partial solution cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
